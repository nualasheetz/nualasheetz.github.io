<p>My name is Nuala Sheetz. I am an English as a Second Language teacher. I have over 25 years of teaching experience and have taught at City College of San Francisco (CCSF) since 2001. </p>
<hr>   
<p>I started teaching online in 2021 and wanted to learn more about HTML. I have been able to be both an instructor and student of CCSF. 
    Classes are free for San Francisco residents. 
        It has excellent instructors and offers convenient online classes. 
        I've learned a lot from the HTML classes there and hope to continue and earn a certificate. Currently my favorite website is 
        <a href="https://www.ccsf.edu/academics/schools/esl-international-ed-and-transitional-studies/english-second-language" target="_blank" >the ESL Deparment page</a> not because it is perfect, but because it represents a great effort by our department to be welcoming to all. The sudden move to an online format for our classes was very difficult. We were not prepared to guide students in registering and studying online. We have a long way to go to eliminate barriers for our students but we have made great progress.

<h2>Websites for Studying HTML</h2>
<dl>
    <dt><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css" target="_blank">Khan Academy:Intro to HTML/CSS</a></dt>
        <dd>Khan Academy is a free website that provides video instruction and practice exercises for many topics including HTML. 
        I learn well through engaging videos. To solidify what I've learned I need to practice it. 
        This website offers both of these in a series of lessons and assignments.</dd> 
        
        
    

    <dt><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/"  target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">W3Schools.com</a><dt>
        <dd>This is one website that I find myself referring to over and over. 
          I first used it when I took an introduction to programming in Python class and was very happy to see that it also covers 
          HTML topics.
        It is very clearly laid out with logical progression through the lessons, a clear navigation, and lots of examples. 
            I also like the <em>try it </em>feature which lets me see the coding and the result side by side.</dd>
    
        

            

    <dt><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/" target="blank" >Linkedin Learning (formerly Lynda.com)</a></dt>
        <dd>Linkedin is a good place to network with others in your field and to search for jobs, but it is also a place to study. 
        They offer many courses including HTML. I am lucky to be able to take some of these for free through my work, 
        but they are available to everyone for a fee</dd>
