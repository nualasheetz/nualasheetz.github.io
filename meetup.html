            <p>On January 31, 2022 Coding Temple Dallas Instructor Devon Wehrlin presented an online presentation entitled <cite>Intro to Javascript</cite>.
                In this one-hour presentation she went through around 60 slides at breakneck speed. 
                The presentation was organized into 4 modules: Programming Basics, History of JavaScript, JavaScript Language, and Advanced JavaScript.

                The "introduction" to Java was more of a 1-hr crash course. If that is representative of the bootcamps they offer, I don't think they would help me. I am glad to be able to take classes at CCSF.
                
                Near the end of the presentation, participants were given assignments to complete. For example we were asked to use for/ in conditional statements. </p>

                    <p>On May 17, 2022, students in CCSF CNIT 195 presented their group project. 
                        It is a game that will encourage people to exercise by making it fun. 
                        They studied what made other games popular and decided that it should be dynamic and social. 
                        They developed their game using several languages including Bootstrap, JavaScript, and CSS. 
                        They also used Discord to aid in collaboration as they developed their game together. 
                        They were still working on finishing touches including making the game work on all platforms and making it responsive.
                        It was inspiring to see real-world applications to the skills they attained in the CNIT program at City College.
